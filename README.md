# Machine Learning Model in Godot Game Engine

### Motivation

With the rising interest in machine learning and AI, I wanted to familiarize myself with these important technologies. This guided project served a dual purpose: it served as my initiation into Machine Learning and also acted as an examination project for my Software Engineering studies, wherein I authored technical documentation for the project and defended its implementation.

### Technical details

This project was fully made in Godot Game Engine using GDScript.
Neural network used by the model is a single-layer neural network.

### Run the model locally

Currently only a Linux build is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/124DTzl1jFMKozbfL1tq7ZDgAjaND5gjt?usp=sharing

#### Linux

Make the required files executable

```bash
chmod +x MLModel.sh
```

```bash
chmod +x MLModel.x86_64
```

Run the model

```bash
./MLModel.sh
```
