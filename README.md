# Machine Learning Model in Godot Game Engine

### Motivation

With the rising interest in machine learning and AI, I wanted to familiarize myself with these important technologies. This guided project served a dual purpose: it served as my initiation into Machine Learning and also acted as an examination project for my Software Engineering studies, wherein I authored technical documentation for the project and defended its implementation.

### Tech stack

This project was fully made in Godot Game Engine using GDScript.
